# ETO_IKMparse

ETO_IKMparse is a library for parsing Autodesk Inventor Engineer-to-Order IKM files.  It uses the [Antlr] parser generator library. It's useful for rewriting parts of an IKM file.  See the tests project for an example of how to use it.  It's been tested on a few files but probably still has some bugs.
